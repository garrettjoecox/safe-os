## What is this?

This project compiles my list of notes and scripts for curating a safe, sandboxed computing environment for my children.

## Desired features:
- Boot straight into a limited desktop environment, without access to Terminal, Settings, an App Store, or other system-level features.
    - Typical keybindings should be disabled
    - Right click context menus should be disabled
    - There needs to be some sort of hidden escape hatch for parents to access system settings when needed. Password protected.
- In the dock, display a curated list of applications to choose from. Examples range from
    - Minecraft (With online play disabled)
    - Scratch
    - Notepad
    - Paint
    - A PBS Kids icon that launches into a kiosk-mode web browser, preventing navigation away from pbskids.org and hiding the address bar.

## Technologies used:
TBD.
